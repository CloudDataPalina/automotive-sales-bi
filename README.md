## 📌 Project Overview

This project delivers executive-level BI dashboards designed to evaluate:

- Sales performance  
- Profit concentration  
- Dealer efficiency  
- Product quality risks  
- Customer sentiment trends  

The solution transforms structured operational datasets into strategic, decision-ready insights for management.  
The dashboards simulate real-world executive reporting scenarios and performance monitoring environments.

Implemented in:

- IBM Cognos Analytics  
- Google Looker Studio  

The analytical logic was consistently replicated across both platforms to demonstrate tool-agnostic BI architecture.

## 📊 Executive KPIs

- **$78.4M Total Profit**
- **58,118 Units Sold**
- **19.37 Avg Units per Dealer**

All metrics were calculated within the BI layer using aggregation logic (SUM, AVG) and categorical segmentation across models, dealers, and systems.

# 🔎 Key Business Insights

### Profit Concentration

- Revenue is heavily concentrated among a limited group of dealers.
- A clear performance gap exists between top and underperforming dealers.

**Implication:** Structural imbalance within the dealer network.  
**Action:** Dealer benchmarking, KPI normalization, and regional optimization.

---

### Product Portfolio Dependence

- A small number of vehicle models generate the majority of total sales volume.

**Implication:** Portfolio concentration risk and reduced diversification.  
**Action:** Targeted product strategy and balanced marketing allocation.

---

### Seasonality

- Peak performance in May  
- Decline in August  
- Recovery toward Q4  

**Implication:** Revenue volatility and uneven operational load.  
**Action:** Seasonal demand planning and promotional alignment.

---

# 🛠 Quality & Risk Analytics

### Recall Concentration

- Certain vehicle models demonstrate elevated recall volumes.

**Risk:** Financial exposure and potential reputational impact.  
**Action:** Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and strengthened quality control procedures.

---

### Defect Clustering

Heatmap-based analysis identified recurring issues in:

- Airbag systems  
- Powertrain components  
- Structural elements  

**Implication:** Possible systemic manufacturing or supplier-related risks.

---

### Customer Sentiment

- 58.57% Positive  
- 22.47% Neutral  
- 18.96% Negative  

**Observation:** Nearly 20% negative sentiment may correlate with recall clustering and quality concerns.
